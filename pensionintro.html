          prior to 6 April 2016, you may not receive the full new State Pension - a deduction will be made to reflect
          the pension built up in the occupational or personal pension scheme as a result of the period when you were

        <div class="list dte-bto">It is the age that you wish to start to draw your pension savings. This age could be
          different to your State Pension Age.</div>
        <div class="list dte-bto">For most people the minimum age that you can access your pension saving is 55. From
          2028 the government’s intention is that the minimum age will be increased to 57.</div>
        <div class="list dte-bto">If you have already reached the age that you set as Retirement Age, the calculations
          assume that you will retire immediately.</div>
        <div class="list dte-bto">For example, if you are age 65 years and 4 months and you select 65 as your Retirement
          Age, the calculations assume that you will retire immediately - at age 65 and 4 months. If you select 66 as
          your Retirement Age the calculations assume that you will retire on your 66th Birthday.</div>

      <div class="intro-detail">
        <div class="list dte-bto">Pension contributions usually receive tax-relief. We've assumed that tax-relief is
          already included in your contributions.</div>
        <div class="list dte-bto">When you receive your pension, any amounts above your personal allowance will be taxed
          as income, in the same way as your salary. All income figures shown in the calculator are amounts before any
          tax is taken off.</div>
        <div class="list dte-bto">However, you can normally take up to 25% of your fund at retirement as a tax-free lump
          sum.</div>
        <div class="list dte-bto">Where tax bands are shown, the amounts are based on the current (2018/2019) levels.
          The calculator makes no attempt to predict future tax-levels.</div>

      <div class="intro-detail">
        <div class="list dte-bto">The Annual Allowance limits the tax relief on pension savings made each tax year and
          is £40,000 for 2018/19. Exceeding the Annual Allowance can result in tax charges being applied, however,
          unused Annual Allowance from the three previous years can sometimes prevent or reduce such a charge. For high
          earners, the Annual Allowance is reduced by £1 for every £2 of income between £150,000 and £210,000.</div>
        <div class="list dte-bto">The calculations make no allowance for the Annual Allowance.</div>

          without triggering an extra tax charge. The Lifetime Allowance generally only applies to people with very high
          earnings or to people who have built up significant pension savings over their career.</div>
        <div class="list dte-bto">The current Lifetime Allowance (2018/19) is £1,030,000.</div>
